# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Dart

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Dart. Two players take turns to place their markers (`X` and `O`) on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (a draw).

## Features
- Interactive player input
- Validates moves to ensure they are within range and not already taken
- Detects a win or draw condition
- Option to replay the game after each round

## Prerequisites

2. Ensure Dart is properly added to your system's PATH.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Players take turns to place their markers (`X` for Player 1 and `O` for Player 2) by entering a number (1-9) corresponding to the cell position.
